	        	<h4 class='font-weight-bold'>Class Emails</h4>
	        	The teacher has to set up the list of email addresses of their class. This can be done in the “Insert New Student” page and accomplishing the form. Entries can also be removed from the database through the “Delete Student” page by typing in the database ID (DB ID) listed in the “Student Database” page. <br><br>
